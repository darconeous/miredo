  In the mean time, proper support was added within the Linux kernel.
# Fix minor server DNS name resolution error handling.

===========================================================================
STABLE RELEASE 1.1.5 : Minor bug fixes

# Fix SIGHUP signal handling.
# Fix compiling on MacOS X and/or without libJudy.

===========================================================================
STABLE RELEASE 1.1.4 : Minor bug fixes

# Fix client-hook script problems with Fedora.
# Fix unlikely race condition in Teredo maintenance procedure setup.

===========================================================================
STABLE RELEASE 1.1.3 : Major bug fixes, minor feature enhancement

# Fix Teredo address randomization (reachability problems).
# Better debug messages.
# Allow GNU General Public License version 3 (and would be later).

===========================================================================
TEST RELEASE 1.1.2 : Minor bug fixes

# Fix filtering error within miredo-server (regression from 1.1.0).

===========================================================================
TEST RELEASE 1.1.1 : Minor bug fixes

# Fix fatal padding mistake on old ABI ARM achitecture.

===========================================================================
TEST RELEASE 1.1.0 : Major features enhancement

# Remove NAT type determination:
  Miredo now runs behind any type of NAT. However, connectivity might
  be severely degraded behind the worst devices, such as symmetric NATs.

# Add 12 bits of randomness to Teredo client address:
  Teredo addresses are less predictible, which should enhance host
  protection against network scanning.

# Remove brittle and battery-unfriendly "autoclient" mode:
  Proper default IPv6 source address selection (RFC3484) implementation
  would address most of the use cases for this, as well as other issues.
  If that is not sufficient, an external connection management system
  is anyway needed to start/stop Miredo when appropriate.

# Restore "cone" RelayType:
  All relays should use it, as it improves support for some kinds of
  (pretty broken but nevertheless deployed) NAT devices.

# Minor specification conformance fixes to miredo-server.
# Use a hook shell script for client interface configuration.
# Add a bunch of debug messages to debug builds.
# Rewrite clock subsystem to avoid polling when idle (battery savings).
# Some minor bug fixes.

===========================================================================
STABLE RELEASE 1.0.6 : Minor features enhancement

# Fix support for Teredo peers behind symmetric NATs (bug from 0.9.8).
  This could probably be used to spoof a Teredo clients.
# MacOS X compilation fix.

===========================================================================
STABLE RELEASE 1.0.5 : Major bug fixes

# Fix issues with timer and compiler optimizations (bug from 0.9.4).
# Increase ping test hop limit:
  Some IPv6 native nodes could not be reached otherwise.
# Increase HMAC secret size from 64 to 128 bits.
# Fix filtering of packets with link-local source address (bug from 0.4.0).
# Various fixes to the experimental ISATAP daemon.

============================================================================
STABLE RELEASE 1.0.4 : Major bug fix

# Fix packet storm with Teredo client behind symmetric NATs.

============================================================================
STABLE RELEASE 1.0.3 : Minor feature enhancement

# Better detection of symmetric NATs and access network changes.
# Limit spamming of syslog.

============================================================================
STABLE RELEASE 1.0.2 : Minor portability and bug fixes

# Several portability and minor/impossible bug fixes (see ChangeLog).

============================================================================
STABLE RELEASE 1.0.1 : Minor portability fixes

# Install configuration file samples into a dedicated directory.
# Build fixes (libteredo would not link on Mac OS X).

# Fix multiple problems with HMAC/ping authentication of non-Teredo nodes.
# Increase timestamp wrap time from 18 hours to 70 years to avoid replay
  attacks against authentication tokens.
# Allow Router Advertisement through the ISATAP tunnel (untested).
  isatapd remain very experimental, particular client-side.
  Someone ought to make a clean kernel implementation instead.
# Use HMAC instead of random nonces in Teredo clients.

=============================================================================

# Removed too brittle cone NAT support. As a side effect, miredo is much
  faster to startup in client mode in most cases.
# Fix server-side handling of Windows Vista client solicitations.
# Removed the IgnoreConeBit configure option. The cone bit is now always
  ignored (this was the default ever since the introduction of that option).

=============================================================================

# More refined system clock usage brings about 30% performance boost.

=============================================================================
BETA RELEASE 0.9.3 : Major features enhancement, major bug fixes

# Use dedicated thread for packets transmission and reception. Miredo

# Build libmiredo dynamically to reduce global code size.
# Fix inclusion of non-PIC code into shared libraries.

(Unstable version 0.9.3 includes all fixes from stable version 0.8.5)

=============================================================================
BETA RELEASE 0.9.1 : Major features enhancement

# Created and referenced a developper mailing list: <miredo-devel at
  remlab.net>. Send a mail with subject “subscribe” to <miredo-devel-request
  at remlab.net> to subscribe.

# Added isatap, an ISATAP router based on libtun6 and miredo.
  After careful IETF IPR claim check, it seems ISATAP can be freely
  implemented anyway.

# Working support for Mac OS X:
  - work-around overly long closefrom() replacement,
  - work-around tuntap for OS X spurious initialization error.
  - add required defines for pthread to work properly.

# Added libteredo-miredo, an undocumented Teredo “test card”.
# Improve miredo-checkconf semantics.
# Multi-threaded libteredo, and finer grained locking.
# Fix initialization in libteredo sometimes causing a crash at startup.
# Fix race condition in libteredo-list unit test.
# Fix _impossible_ overflow of FD_SET().

(Unstable version 0.9.1 includes all fixes from stable version 0.8.4)

=============================================================================
STABLE RELEASE 0.8.2 : Minor bugfixes

# New “autoclient” mode (RelayType directive in miredo.conf):
  This is similar to client, except that Miredo will disable Teredo
  tunneling completely whenever there is another IPv6-enabled networking
  interface that appears to provide global IPv6 connectivity.

# Insufficient privileges settings fix when using POSIX capabilities.
# -t or --chrootdir option reintroduced to configure chroot at run-time.
# Update and improve BinReloc for Linux support.
# Removed useless, if not confusing, DefaultRoute configuration directive.
# Support for tunnel interface naming on FreeBSD.
# Various manual pages updates and fixes.
# Various NetBSD, OpenBSD and Mac OS X portability fixes.
# libteredo made a C99 (C++-less) library with a working C API.

=============================================================================
STABLE RELEASE 0.8.1 : Security/bug fixes

# Fix possible non-Teredo IPv6 node impersonation toward Teredo client
  due to an input validation error.
# Change sample configuration default Teredo server to “teredo.remlab.net”.
# Fix segmentation fault at exit when specifying a server name from the
  command line.
# Fix locking and deletion of PID file in background (default) mode.
# New program: miredo-checkconf to verify configuration file syntax.
# Partial support for NetBSD 4.0 (still not completely working).
# libtun6 is now a reusable shared library.
# Code clean up and other minor bug fixes.

=============================================================================
STABLE RELEASE 0.8.0 : Minor bugfixes

# Now use permanent Teredo prefix 2001:0:: default instead of 3ffe:831f::.
# (Linux-only) Fix setting of /proc/sys/net/ipv6/conf/<iface>/* entries.
# Fix some spelling errors in documentation.
# Many compilation fixes for FreeBSD 6.0 (also backported in v0.7.3).
# Fix --enable-debug configure option (also in v0.7.3).
# Use RFC 4380 as reference instead of Teredo ultimate draft 05.

=============================================================================
BETA RELEASE 0.7.1 : Major features enhancement

# One hundred time more scalable peers list: Miredo should now be able to
  handle a few hundreds of thousands of peers simultaneously while it would
  hardly hundle one thousand previously. That is done with Judy dynamic
  arrays (an external very fast LGPL library for hash tables). If Judy is
  not available, the old naive and not scalable linked list algorithm will
  still be used.
# Basic working garbage collector for peers list.
# Better Echo Requests and Teredo bubbles timings as regards draft 05.
# Add --enable-debug configure option. Without this, debug stuff will no
  longer be included.
# Reset peers list when Teredo client status changes (bug fix)

=============================================================================
BETA RELEASE 0.7.0 : Minor features enhancement, security/bugs fixes

# Make efforts to retry sending UDP packets in case of ICMP failure.
# Partially rewritten IPv6 tunneling driver; now supports Darwin (Mac OS X).
# Emit ICMPv6 Address unreachable error packets when a destination cannot
  be reached via Teredo tunneling.
# Force 2-seconds delay between multiple Echo Requests and Teredo bubbles.
# Use HMAC-MD5 for Echo Requests “nonce”, rather than kernel entropy pool
  (heavily reduce kernel entropy pool usage).
# Fix Teredo client maintenance in case of system clock drift (could be
  caused by SIGSTOP, APM/ACPI/software suspend, debugger, or system load).
# Define Linux kernel 2.6.9 as the minimum supported Linux kernel version.
# Use kernel IPv6 stack to generate IPv6 headers for ICMPv6 errors
  (allow proper source address selection, and use of optimized checksum).
# Fix Teredo peers list lookup (major bugfix also backported in 0.5.6).
# Various optimizations and clean up throughout the code.
# Added some regression tests.
# Re-resolve server IP address when connectivity fails.
# Remove chroot by default (prevents DNS resolution without platform
  specific setup).
# Fix minor race condition that “never happens” in Teredo client.

=============================================================================
BETA RELEASE 0.5.4 : Major bugfixes

# Fix Teredo client connectivity toward Teredo clients.

=============================================================================
BETA RELEASE 0.5.3 : Minor bugfixes

# Some portability fixes.
# Minor fix to Router Advertisement parsing (not an exploitable bug).
# Some code optimization.
# Smaller memory footprint per peers.

=============================================================================
BETA RELEASE 0.5.2 : Major bugfixes

# Fix sending of Router Solicitation in case of transient packet loss.
# Ignore unexpected Router Advertisment.
# Fix use of freed memory in configuration parser error handling.
# Some more optimization and clean up.
# Peers list size limit.
# Multi-thread Teredo server implementation.
# Build libteredo as a shared library (warning: API is not stabilized yet).

=============================================================================
BETA RELEASE 0.5.1 : Minor bugfixes

# Set a bigger metric (lower priority) for Teredo’s default IPv6 route than
  usual default IPv6 route, so that one can safely run miredo even if/when
  other/better IPv6 connectivity is otherwise available (Linux-only).
# Some code optimization for better performance.
# Allow running miredo as root (if and only if explicitly enabled through
  ./configure).
# Fix use of POSIX capabilities with miredo-server.
# Fix compilation on FreeBSD.
# Fix adding/removal of tunnel route on FreeBSD.
# Fix POSIX mutex deletion on exit.
# Fix incorrect/useless passing of Teredo maintenance packets to IPv6 stack.
# Support for OpenBSD operating system.
# Would-be support for NetBSD operating system.

=============================================================================
BETA RELEASE 0.5.0 : Major features enhancement

# Fix for infinite loop in client when processing advertisement from server
  (also backported in release 0.4.3).
# Finally implemented correct Teredo maintenance procedure / qualification
  and connectivity loss detection (which is now quicker).
# Regenerate server authentication token (“nonce”) every hour for increased
  security.
# Limit ICMPv6 Echo Requests sent to 3 per peer every 30 seconds.
# Safe work-around to reach peers that rejects ICMPv6 Echo Requests.
# Support for MTU setting (in server and relay),
  clients now gets MTU setting from server.
# Support for changing Teredo server’s secondary address (ServerAddress2
  and ServerBindAddress2 directives).
# Fix a minor race condition when the Teredo tunnel is brought up.

# Teredo server support separated : it is now provided by a separate binary
  “miredo-server”, that reads its configuration from “miredo-server.conf”.
  Additionnally, the Teredo server now use raw IPv6 socket rather than the
  Teredo tunneling interface, so that one doesn’t need to enabled IPv6
  forwarding on the Teredo server (and it is more portable).

# Rudimentary Autopackage support (autopackage being still buggy).

=============================================================================
BETA RELEASE 0.4.2 : Major bugfixes, minor features enhancement

# Fixed connectivity issue with restricted Teredo clients/relays.
# Re-implemented connectivity loss detection. The older version was removed
  because it would not tolerate any packet loss.
# Support for overriding the server specified in miredo.conf from the
  command line.
# Fixed handling by client of unauthenticated server responses.
# Some clean up.

=============================================================================
BETA RELEASE 0.4.1 : Minor bugfixes

# Fixed privileges separation issue on Linux with grsecurity patch.
# Work-around a Linux kernel panic bug when bringing an interface down.
# Fixed use of “RelayType disabled” - Miredo would always fail in that mode.
# Improved sample configuration file comments.
# Print logging information on the console with option -f (foreground run).
# Complain when no sever was specified in client mode.

=============================================================================
BETA RELEASE 0.4.0 : Major features enhancement

# Configuration file :
  Miredo now reads its settings from a configuration file, miredo.conf,
  instead of many command line options. A sample commented
  configuration is provided in misc/miredo.conf-dist and installed in
  /usr/local/etc/miredo.conf-dist (unless you use another installation
  prefix).

# Support for disabling components at build-time :
  That helps producing a smaller executable. In particular, you may
  consider running “./configure --disable-teredo-server” as very few
  people really use the Teredo server component.
  “--disable-teredo-client” is also provided if you only want to build
  a Teredo relay.

# Zero-memcpy, performance improvement :
  Miredo will no longer perform any memcpy on forwarded IPv6 packets
  payload, so as to improve processing speed a little bit.

# Automatic and easy-to-setup chroot environment :
  Miredo only needs an empty directory to chroot. It is created by
  make install and automatically used.

# PID file moved: it is now located in /usr/local/var/run/miredo.pid by
  default.

# Support for server only mode (no longer have to run a relay as well).

# Support for changing syslogd facility used via miredo.conf.

# Cleaned up server implementation.

# Fixed packet source/destination IPv6 addresses checks in client/relay.

=============================================================================
BETA RELEASE 0.3.2 : Minor bugfixes

# Configure option --enable-pidfile=<path> to change the pidfile path
  (or --disable-pidfile to disable pidfile generation)

# Safer default configuration : Miredo uses the “nobody” user which
  should exists on any system, instead of root by default.

# FreeBSD compilation fixes.

=============================================================================
BETA RELEASE 0.3.1 : Minor features enhancement

# POSIX.1e capabilities support :
  If you have libcap on your system, miredo will now use POSIX.1e
  capabilities. That should reduce the possible impact of a hypothetic
  compromise of the program.

# Gettext internationalization support :
  Miredo can now be localized in other languages beside English.
  A French translation is provided. Other translations will be included
  upon submission by volunteer translators.

# PID file:
  Miredo can low create a PID file as /var/run/miredo/miredo.pid which can
  be useful to make initscripts.

=============================================================================
BETA RELEASE 0.3.0 : Major features enhancement

# Proper queueing of packets :
  That should speed up connectivity a bit, and fix various connectivity
  issues most particularly with, though not limited to, Teredo clients.

# Automatically select an available UDP port for relay and client.
  You can use the “-p” command line option to specify a particular port
  number.

# Automatically add a default route through the Teredo tunneling interface
  when running Miredo as a Teredo client.
  
# Fixed a bug that may prevent the client from working correctly.

# Compilation fix for the Darwin kernel (Mac OS X).
  Miredo needs a separate tunnel device driver to run on Darwin; it can
  be found there: http://chrisp.de/en/projects/tunnel.html

# Untested support for OpenBSD, NetBSD and Darwin. In any case, routing
  does not work on Darwin, and the program might not compile on OpenBSD
  and NetBSD at all (help appreciated).

=============================================================================
BETA RELEASE 0.2.2 : Minor portability fixes

# Support for binding the relay/client to a specific IPv4 address
  with the -b (--bind) command line option.
# Compilation fix for some old GNU libc.

=============================================================================
BETA RELEASE 0.2.1 : Major bugfixes

# Fixed a segmentation fault in Teredo server code.
# Fixed client-to-client connectivity with Microsoft and ng_teredo servers.
# Various minor client timing problem fixed.

=============================================================================
BETA RELEASE 0.2.0 : Major features enhancement

# Ability to run as a Teredo client:
    Miredo can now server as a Teredo client. It will set up its Teredo
  address automatically from a server then forward packets. However, you
  have to add a default route to the Teredo tunneling interface if you want
  to use Miredo to access the IPv6 Internet as a whole, instead of only other
  Teredo clients. Of course, a server name to must be specified for the
  client mode to work.

# Ability to run behind a restricted NAT device:
    Miredo’s Teredo relaying functions should now work fine from behind a
  restricted NAT device (such as most Linux/Netfilter-based NAT). If you are
  not behind a NAT or if you are behind a cone NAT, you can use command line
  option “-C” for optimization.

=============================================================================
ALPHA RELEASE 0.1.1 : Major features enhancement

# Partial support for FreeBSD:
    Miredo should compile fine on FreeBSD, however it was not yet tested on
  that platform. Feedback is most welcome.

# Ability to disable server functionality:
    The server is now disabled by default.

# Ability to change the Teredo prefix (with -P).

# Ability to change the Teredo relay port (with -p).

# Automatic Teredo tunneling interface configuration:
    Miredo will automatically set the interface local IPv6 address, and set
  up an IPv6 route toward Teredo clients through the tunneling interface.
  Additionnaly, the interface MTU will be set to 1280 as suggested by the
  latest Teredo draft specification, and is automatically brought up and
  running.

# Possible vulnerabilities impact mitigation:
    Miredo will drop its root privileges as soon as possible, setuid to
  “miredo” user (which you should create, or change at run time), setgid,
  and chroot. For chroot to work, some manual setup is needed.

# Background run:
    Miredo will automatically detach and run in the background as a “daemon”.

# Automatic relay address configuration:
    One no longer has to specify the relay IPv4 and IPv6 addresses. This is
  no longer needed.

# Signals handling: miredo can now be terminated cleanly.

# Minor compliance update for Teredo draft 02, various minor bugfixes.

# Added a manpage.

# Build-time support for Intel C++ Compiler 8.0.
