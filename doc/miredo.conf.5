.TH "MIREDO.CONF" "5" "$Date$" "miredo" "System Manager's Manual"
.SH NAME
miredo.conf \- configuration for Miredo
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B miredo.conf

.SH DESCRIPTON
.I miredo.conf
.RB " is the configuration file for " "Miredo" "."
Each configuration directive consists of one directive name, possibly
followed by one or several spaces and a value for the directive.
White spaces, empty lines and lines starting with '#' are ignored.

Directives are case-insensitive. A comprehensive list of the supported
directives follows:

.SH MODES

.TP
.BR "RelayType" " (" "client" "|" "cone" "|" "restricted" ")"
Specifies what type of Teredo relay/client Miredo will serve as.
There are three possible choices:

.TP
.BR "client" " mode (the default)"
.RB "In " "client" " mode, " "Miredo" " acts as a "
.IR "Teredo client" ". Miredo will first authenticate with a "
.I "Teredo server"
.RB "(see " "ServerAddress" "), and if successful, will setup a Teredo"
tunneling interface with a public Teredo IPv6 address and a default
IPv6 route. That virtual networking interface can be used to reach the
IPv6 Internet as well as Teredo clients.

The use of Miredo as a Teredo client allows nodes to get an IPv6
connectivity from behind a NAT router device, as it tunnels IPv6
packets over UDP/IPv4 with special support for NAT routers. Routers of
that kind usually only forward TCP, UDP and ICMP over IPv4 packets
.RB "(with some limitation), so that " "6to4 tunneling" " and "
.BR "Proto-41 " "forwarding cannot be used to reach the IPv6 Internet"
from behind them.

.BR "NOTE:" " Use of " "Miredo" " as a"
.IR "Teredo client" " is possible even if the system already has IPv6"
connectivity through another way (native, 6to4, TSP, etc). In that
case, Miredo will only be used to reach other Teredo clients. Care
should be taken that default IPv6 routes metrics are adequate
.RB "(see also " "DefaultRoute" ")."

.TP
.BR "cone" " mode"
.RB "In " "cone" " mode, " "Miredo" " acts as a "
.IR "Teredo relay" ". It will assume that it has public global " "IPv4"
.RI "connectivity or from behind a " "cone" " NAT device. Miredo will"
create a virtual networking interface with a route toward Teredo
clients.

.IR "Teredo relays" " forward IPv6 packets between " "Teredo clients"
.RB "and the IPv6 Internet. For that to work, Teredo relays " "MUST"
have a working IPv6 connectivity through a way other than Teredo
tunneling.

This mode can be used if the node has a public IPv4 address or if it is
.RI "behind a NAT router of " "cone" " type. If the type of NAT is not"
.RI "known, " "restricted" " mode should be used instead."

.TP
.BR "restricted" " mode"
.RB "In " "restricted" " mode, " "Miredo" " acts as a "
.IR "Teredo relay" ", as in " "cone" " mode. However, optimizations "
for Teredo relaying behind a cone NAT are disabled.

.BR "NOTE:" " NAT devices of type"
.IR "symmetric" " are not supported by the " "Teredo protocol" "."
.RB "Miredo " "cannot" " be used from behind that kind of NAT routers."

.SH CLIENT OPTIONS
.RI "The following directives are only available in " "client" " mode."

.TP
.BI "ServerAddress " "hostname"
.RB "The " "ServerAddress" " directive specifies the hostname or "
.RI "numerical IPv4 address of the " "Teredo server" " to use."
.IR "Teredo clients" " needs a  " "Teredo server" " to establish and"
maintain their IPv6 over UDP/IPv4 tunnel across a NAT device.

.RB "This directive " "MUST" " be specified when Miredo is in"
.IR "client" " mode. " "hostname" " must resolve to a valid IPv4"
address. If it is not present, and no server hostname is specified on
the command line when starting miredo either, the program will fail.

.TP
.BI "ServerAddress2 " "hostname2"
Miredo assumes that the secondary Teredo server address equals the
primary server address plus one. If that is not the case, this
directive must be used.

.TP
.BR "DefaultRoute " "on/off"
Enable or disable the creation of a default IPv6 route through the
Teredo tunneling interface.
.RB "Defaults to " "on" "."


.SH RELAY OPTIONS
.RI "The following directive is only available in " "cone" ", "
.IR "restricted" " and " "disabled" " mode. They are not available in"
.IR "client" " mode."

.TP
.BI "Prefix " "teredo_prefix"
.RB "This directive specifies the " "Teredo prefix" " which the Teredo"
relay and/or server will advertise.
.IR "teredo_prefix" " must be a valid IPv6 prefix."

.RB "The default value is " "2001:0000::" " (it was " "3ffe:831f::"
in pre-0.8.0 versions).

.BR "Do not use that directive" " if you don't know what you are"
doing, as it is more than likely to break your Teredo connectivity.
That option must not be used when Miredo serves as a Teredo client.

.TP
.BI "InterfaceMTU " "mtu"
This directive overrides the default MTU size of 1280 bytes for the
Teredo tunneling interface. It should not be used if the default Teredo
prefix is used.

.SH GENERAL OPTIONS
.TP
.BI "InterfaceName " "ifname"
Specify the name of the Teredo tunneling interface which Miredo will
create ("miredo" by default). On some systems, it is not possible to
redefine the tunnel name.

.TP
.BI "BindAddress " "bind_address"
Bind the Teredo relay or Teredo client to a specific IPv4 address.
By default, it is not bound to any particular IPv4 address.

Use this option if you have trouble with the default value, such as if
you have a multi-homed host with equal-cost IPv4 routing, or if you
have specific firewalling constraints.

.TP
.BI "BindPort " "udp_port"
Define the UDP (IPv4) port number to be used by the relay or client.
By default, the operating system allocates an unused port
automatically.

Use this option if you have firewalling constraints which can cause
Miredo to fail when not using a fixed predefined port.

.TP
.BI "SyslogFacility " "facility"
Specify which syslog's facility is to be used by Miredo for logging.
.RB "Possible values are: " "daemon" " (the default), " "local0" ","
.RB "... " "local7" ", " "kern" " and " "user" " (see syslog(2))."
